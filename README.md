Project Report: Personal Expense and Savings Tracker

1. Problem Definition
As a college student, managing personal finances can be hard since it usually leads to difficulties in budgeting monthly allowances. The majority of them do not have a well-structured system where tracking of spending against income and, importantly, prioritizing and building emergency savings can be done. In the absence of any structured approach, students are likely to overspend and hence face difficulties in covering unexpected expenditures.The main purpose of the project, in addressing this critical need for financial discipline and awareness, is to develop an Expense Tracking Application that will track daily expenditures but also promote and facilitate money saving.

2. Language Used
The application was developed in Python. Because Python is highly readable, with very extensive library support and rapid development, it was the perfect choice to efficiently implement various aspects of the core logic and the UI components of the tracker.

3. Solution: Application Description and Functionality
The developed application is a customizable and educational personal finance tool, going beyond the basic functionalities of standard expense trackers. It is designed to offer a holistic view of the user's financial health, via dynamic input and savings promotion.

Key Features:-
=> Dynamic Income Input: Unlike applications with hardcoded values, the user actually enters their exact monthly income/allowance to feed the budgeting with an individualized starting point.
=> Savings Recommendation System: The application introduces the concept of saving and advises on an initial recommended amount of savings. After this, the application gives users the freedom to adjust and set their desired savings goal.
=> Savings Logic Explanation: The app offers an explanation on *how the amount to save was calculated; for example, a general percentage or a formula used to reach the suggested savings amount.
=> Categorizing Expenses and Budgeting: Once a savings goal is set, the remaining monthly fund would be divided among standard spending categories such as Food, Home, Work/Study, Fun, and Miscellaneous. Then, the app would suggest how much money should be spent on each category.
=> Savings Usage Tracking: This is a very unique feature where a user can record if and when money is utilised out of their fund that they have been saving, which helps to give a complete picture about financial movements.

Expense History Review: This will let users review a detailed history of their expenses, enabling them to analyze spending patterns over time and make more informed adjustments to their budgets.

4. How It Helps People:
The application has several high-impact benefits targeted principally at young adults and anyone desiring improved financial control:
=>Promotes Financial Awareness:- The application requires users to input their income and set savings goals actively. Thus, it forces a conscious engagement with their finances, and the users are fully aware of their budget constraints.
=>Encourages Emergency Savings:- The dedicated focus on savings, with a recommendation system and usage tracking, will strongly encourage users to build a safety net for unexpected expenses that will help them foster long-term financial stability. 
=>Facilitates Better Budgeting:- The proposed spending limits on different categories assist in helping the users allocate funds responsibly to avoid overspending on discretionary areas and ensuring that their essential needs get met. Empowers Decision Making: The transparency in the logic of savings recommendations makes users not blindly follow an algorithm, but empowers them to make educated choices  about their savings and spending patterns.
